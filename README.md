Hi,
this is the kwant project
so the plan is :
1. Implement the ring
2. Add some atoms to the leads
3. Study the "properties" (e.g.  transmission), with some parameters (e.g.  energy,dimension,...)
4. add the magnetic field
5. Study the "properties" (e.g.  transmission), with some parameters (e.g.  energy,dimension,...)
6. add the potential on each arms
7. Study the "properties" (e.g.  transmission), with some parameters (e.g.  energy,dimension,...
  and i just test if commit work
